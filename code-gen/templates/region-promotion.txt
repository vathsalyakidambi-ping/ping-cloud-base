Failover steps when current primary fails
=========================================
It is possible for a primary to fail for a long period of time (for example, the region where it is deployed is
unreachable). In the worst case, a primary may fail permanently, i.e. it is not possible to recover the environment.
During such an event, it should be possible to promote an existing secondary cluster to function as the new primary so
that critical functions such as data backups, clustering, etc. still work and SLAs are still able to be honored.

As a corollary to the above, when a previously failed primary comes back up but must be demoted to secondary (because a
new primary was set up while it was down), then it should be possible to do so as well.

In the following examples, this is the initial configuration:

primary: us-east-1
secondary-0: us-west-2
secondary-1: ap-east-1

We assume that primary fails for a long period of time, and secondary-0 is promoted to the new primary. When that step
is complete, the new configuration will be:

primary: us-west-2
secondary-0: ap-east-1

A while later, the former primary is restored. But it must be demoted to a secondary. When that step is complete, the
new configuration will be:

primary: us-west-2
secondary-0: ap-east-1
secondary-1: us-east-1

==========================================
Promote a region from secondary to primary
==========================================

- Open an SRE ticket to make this region's cluster state repo the new primary. This will entail changing the
  background code sync to mirror from this new primary cluster state repo to the other secondary cluster state repos.

- Edit an existing secondary region's top-level env_vars file (e.g. k8s-configs/us-west-2/env_vars).
  - Set PRIMARY_REGION to the same value as that region's REGION variable.
  - Set PRIMARY_TENANT_DOMAIN to the same value as that region's TENANT_DOMAIN variable.
  - For PF DNS_PING, set SECONDARY_TENANT_DOMAINS to include the tenant domains of only the secondary regions.

- Edit the region's ping-cloud/kustomization.yaml file (e.g. k8s-configs/us-west-2/ping-cloud/kustomization.yaml).
  Comment out the `remove-from-secondary-patch.yaml` patch in the `patchesStrategicMerge` section.

- Edit each app's env_vars file (e.g. PD's env_vars would be at
  k8s-configs/us-west-2/ping-cloud/pingdirectory/env_vars). Change the LAST_UPDATE_REASON environment variable to
  something meaningful, e.g. "Promoting region to primary".

- Push the changes up to the server and wait for all Ping applications to be re-rolled.

- When the rollout is complete, this region will become the new primary.

- Verify that data backups work for every Ping application.

===============================================================
Change the other secondary clusters to point to the new primary
===============================================================

- Edit the region's top-level env_vars file (e.g. k8s-configs/ap-east-1/env_vars).
  - Set PRIMARY_REGION to the new primary region, i.e. that of the newly promoted primary.
  - Set PRIMARY_TENANT_DOMAIN to the new primary's tenant domain.
  - For PF DNS_PING, set SECONDARY_TENANT_DOMAINS to include the tenant domains of only the secondary regions.
    cluster S3 bucket in the new primary region.

- Edit each app's env_vars file (e.g. PD's env_vars would be at
  k8s-configs/ap-east-1/ping-cloud/pingdirectory/env_vars). Change the LAST_UPDATE_REASON environment variable to
  something meaningful, e.g. "Pointing region to new primary".

- Push the changes up to the server and wait for all Ping applications to be re-rolled.

- When the rollout is complete, this region will point to the new primary.

- Repeat the above steps on every other secondary cluster.

- When the rollout is complete on all regions, verify that clustering works as expected for every Ping application.

==================================
Demote an old primary to secondary
==================================

- Edit the region's top-level env_vars file (e.g. k8s-configs/us-east-1/env_vars).
  - Set PRIMARY_REGION to the new primary region, i.e. that of the newly promoted primary.
  - Set PRIMARY_TENANT_DOMAIN to the new primary's tenant domain.
  - For PF DNS_PING, set SECONDARY_TENANT_DOMAINS to include the tenant domains of only the secondary regions.
    cluster S3 bucket in the new primary region.

- Edit the region's ping-cloud/kustomization.yaml file (e.g. k8s-configs/us-east-1/ping-cloud/kustomization.yaml).
  Uncomment the `remove-from-secondary-patch.yaml` patch in the `patchesStrategicMerge` section.

- Edit each app's env_vars file (e.g. PD's env_vars would be at
  k8s-configs/us-east-1/ping-cloud/pingdirectory/env_vars). Change the LAST_UPDATE_REASON environment variable to
  something meaningful, e.g. "Demoting region to secondary".

- Push the changes up to the server and wait for all Ping applications to be re-rolled.

- When the rollout is complete, this region will be demoted to secondary and point to the new primary.

- Verify that servers in this cluster join the existing servers for every Ping application.
