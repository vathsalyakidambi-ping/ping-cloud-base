# PGO: The Postgres Operator from Crunchy Data

This directory contains UNMODIFIED manifest yamls with the exception for the image repositories being changed to our ECR repo. They are copied directly from the `./kustomize/install` directory
https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples

ALL directories/files are copied here, even if they are unused. The only portion of this directory that is Ping-specific
is the top-level kustomization.yaml and this README.md.

# Update this when you update this directory based on the postgres-operator-examples repo.
# TODO: improve the process so it's less manual
The specific commit it's referenced against is:
https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples/tree/c35b44b9bcabe6c1fea896bde043ff0e2d4bb43e

# TODO: as of right now, some of these manifest files are unused.
