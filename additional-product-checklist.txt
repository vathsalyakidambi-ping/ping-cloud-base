This file is meant to encompass any additional changes required when adding new products to PingCloud.

Logs
Log files leave the docker container at a container level granularity. This means all logs within a given container
are stored within a single log from the perspective of FluentD. In order to again filter the logs back to an individual
log file granularity to be processed by FluentD, a regex must be created to match each filename. This must be done within
insights.yaml for each new product following the existing patterns in place.

PingAccess WAS
When configuring a new product to be protected by PingAccess WAS we need to make a change in determining whether or not
the configuration completely successfully. In 83-configure-initial-pa-was.sh file we should alter the
is_previously_configured function to account for the extra application now being protected.

DaemonSets
PingDirectory pods are scheduled to run on nodes with the taint "pingidentity.com/pd-only=true:NoSchedule". Every new
DaemonSet in the stack will need to add a toleration for this taint at the very minimum or be configured to tolerate all
taints.
